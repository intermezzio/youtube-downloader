# Youtube Downloader

This set of scripts uses [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/) to download YouTube videos to a computer's `~/Videos` folder. When the script runs, the script checks the Firefox browser and tries to download a video at an open tab. For example, if you have a YouTube video open on Firefox and run the script, the script downloads that video to your computer.

The video downloader script downloads audio and video while the audio downloader just downloads audio. Binding these scripts (e.g. `sh downloadyoutube.sh`) to keyboard shortcuts makes downloading YouTube videos quick and easy, without depending on any third party companies.
